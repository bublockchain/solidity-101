# Solidity 101

The premier solidity course taught by BU Blockchain (@wezabis for the 23-24 year)

#### This is what chatGPT says solidity is: 

Solidity is a high-level programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum blockchain. It is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types among other features. Solidity is influenced by C++, Python, and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. They run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference.

In the context of Ethereum, Solidity is used to write applications that implement self-enforcing business logic embodied in smart contracts, leaving a non-repudiable and authoritative record of transactions. Writing a smart contract in Solidity involves creating functions and state variables that form the structure of the contract which can then interact with other contracts, make decisions, store data, and transfer Ether (the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network) among users.

Given its purpose and design, Solidity enables the creation of a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain, ranging from simple token swaps to complex decentralized finance (DeFi) instruments.
